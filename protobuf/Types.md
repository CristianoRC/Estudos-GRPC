| double      |                                                                                                                                                 |
| float       |                                                                                                                                                 |
| int32       | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead. |
| int64       | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead. |
| uint32      | Uses variable-length encoding.                                                                                                                  |
| uint64      | Uses variable-length encoding.                                                                                                                  |
| sint32      | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s.                            |
| sint64      | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s.                            |
| fixed32     | Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 228.                                                             |
| fixed64     | Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 256.                                                            |
| sfixed32    | Always four bytes.                                                                                                                              |
| sfixed64    | Always eight bytes.                                                                                                                             |
| bool        |                                                                                                                                                 |
| string      | A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text.                                                                                 |
| bytes       | May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes.                                                                                                    |
